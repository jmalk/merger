# merger
Using lodash's merge function to merge two objects.

Clone this repo.
From the directory you've cloned into, run `node server.js`.

If everything is working, the console will tell you that the server is listening on port 3000 by default. Navigate to localhost:3000 to see the result of a merge of two JSON Objects.
